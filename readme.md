### Kotlin native with SFML example

This is an example showing kotlin native with SFML (Linux version).

More info on [Kotlin native](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native)

More info on [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

Use interop.sh to create the cinterop files.

User build.sh to build the executable.

**Note: this needs a recent version of kotlin-native.** I used this version https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/tree/78c043f15ff51660068f7f97da807e1d5ab2742b.
